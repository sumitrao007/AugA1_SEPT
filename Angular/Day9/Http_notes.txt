what is obervable?
It is asynchronous non blocking operations, now here we go to network we call the server but it not available immediately. Its going to some delay, may be 10msec, or half sec its depends on availability  of server so during this time as excuting the code to get block of data so we use obervable when the result is ready to notify for that. obsrvable we have to call method subscribe(). When result is ready will be notify.
