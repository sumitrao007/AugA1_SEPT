Routing Steps
1 Configure the routes
2 Add a router outlet
3 Add links/navigate

1 Confugure Routes
 - In App.module->imports section - define RouterModule.forRoot()
  forRoot is static method defined in RouterModule & it is use to define root route for application
2 add router-outlet tag in app.component.html or from where you want to start navigate you can place it
3 Add links
<a href="/Page1">page1 here we can not use this <a href> tag bcz 
   - when use a-tag its page filker
   - every time we click on tag it download all resoursce on each click
     this will not be happen bcz we developed a modern angular app (i.e. spa) it loads at the first time so instead of <a href> tag we use
the directive called routerlink,this directive is defined in RouterModule 

- Empty Path
The empty path represents the default path for the application, the place to go when the path in the URL is empty, as it typically is at the start



-wildcard 
The ** path in the last route is a wildcard. The router will select this route if the requested URL doesn't match any paths for routes defined earlier in the configuration
